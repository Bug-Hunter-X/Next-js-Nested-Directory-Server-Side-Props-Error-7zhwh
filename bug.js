In Next.js, an uncommon error arises when using server-side props (getStaticProps or getServerSideProps) within a nested directory structure.  If the directory structure isn't properly configured, the pages might not be found or might lead to unexpected behavior.  For instance, if you have a folder structure like `pages/blog/[slug]/index.js`, and you try to access it from a nested path like `/blog/[category]/[slug]`, the dynamic routing might conflict and lead to errors.
